# CometInstaller

An abandoned iOS Package Manager for RootlessJB3 

To use: 

1. install app with xcode
2. ssh and run ``inject /var/containers/Bundle/Application/(whatever comet is)/Comet.app/Comet``
3. the app will now open

(if you want to download tweaks you will need to make a source yourself as this project is discontinued,
see an example Comet repo here: https://github.com/ethereus/CometRepo )
